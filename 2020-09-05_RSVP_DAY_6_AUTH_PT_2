## What We Did

###  Black Lives Matter

### Warm-up

Cassidoo Newsletter Question of the Week https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/music-touches-us-emotionally-where-words-alone/
Given an array of numbers that represent stock prices (where each number is the price for a certain day), find 2 days when you should buy and sell your stock for the highest profit.

Example:
`$ stockBuySell([110, 180, 260, 40, 310, 535, 695])`
`$ “buy on day 4, sell on day 7”`

Outcome:
Have solution~25, but think there's a more performant one. Want to go through solutions next week to see.

### Project

- Continue Authentication
- Got firebase loading properly
- Fix ENV variables with dotenv
- Got some forms working

## What We Learned

- Vanilla React form management strategies
- React doesn't respect the `for` html property. It's `htlmFor` instead
- Quaxo is the German localization for Politoed
- Where the WSL2 filesystem lives, and where the windows files live in relation to that.

## Things to Look Into

- `react-with-firebase-auth` if we get caught up with implementing auth
- fix hot reloading on WSL2
