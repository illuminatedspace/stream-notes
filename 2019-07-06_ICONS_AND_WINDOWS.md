## Set Up

- [x] Stay Hydrated Bot

## Agenda

- [x] Announcements
- [x] Finish Refactoring Icon component to work with GraphQL query and dynamic import of icon images
- [x] Make only one instance of window
- [] Make active window on top?
- [x] See Stay Hydrated Bot?

## What We Did

### Coding

- Refactored Icon component to use dynamic import to get correct icon image
- Use `useEffect` to set initial icon image
- generalized the getIcon component and substituted it for the `getIconHover` and `getIconNotHover`?

### Fun

- Coined the stream phrase "Certified Genius"

## What We Learned

- I can stream with the AC on.
- How to use `useEffect` hook to replace a componentDidMount that only runs one time

## Things to Look Into

- [] Make a Stream Starting Page
- [x] Make a Stream Utils Git
- [x] Did I set up StayHydrated bot correctly?
- [] Certified Genius stream boss
- [x] Certified genius chat command with more ~sincere~ phrasing and takes a twitch handle as an argument
- [] Clarkio's twitch line highlighter extension
