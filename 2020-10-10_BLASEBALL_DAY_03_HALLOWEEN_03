## What We Learned

- SVGs are quick if you understand how to do them.
- If you create SVGs in a program like affinity, it helps to make sure that all the path coordinate points fall on whole numbers so that you can "read' the SVG later and can make changes by hand if necessary.
- GUI programs like Illustrator/Affinity will often output much more verbose SVGs than they have to.

## Things to Look Into

- accessibility dialog reference https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html
