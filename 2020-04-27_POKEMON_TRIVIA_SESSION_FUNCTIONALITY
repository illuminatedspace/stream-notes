# 2020-04-12 POKEMON TRIVIA SESSION FUNCTIONALITY

## Agenda

- [x] Announcements
- [ ] Finish functionality on pokemon trivia site
- [ ] Maybe start styling

## What We Did

### Coding

- Did a lot of work to get the evolution level of the pokemon calling
  3 different APIs and writing a recursive function
- Split the code into different files to reduce respective file sizes

## What We Learned

- Nested data with unknown depth from an API if difficult to work with!
- Import help in Glitch from @kleinfreund
  > So the minimum I needed to do was (1) `type=module` on script tag
  > (2) `import { namedExport } from "./fileName.js"` and
  > (3) `export function namedExport() {}` in `fileName.js`.

## Things to Look Into

- get chat bot running on Glitch
  - "Pok√©mon are not zero-indexed."
  - "Politoed is a good round boy."
