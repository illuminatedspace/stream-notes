### Stream
  - Styled the date time string
  - Made date time string text button for screen reader accessibility
  - Solved the case of the missing store
  - Created starter version of advance_time function
  
## What We Learned

  - you can use `NullAction()` as an action to preserve button functionality without doing anything. Good for a11y.
  - you can interact with variables inside functions in init python blocks, but you must specify the store name, even the default one `store`
