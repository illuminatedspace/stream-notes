# 2020-04-12 BACK TO BASICS PROJECT

## Agenda

- [] Announcements
- [] Build some kind of website I guess?

## What We Did

### Coding

- Injected pokeapi-js-wrapper script into site
- Made an async call to PokeAPI for pokemon
- Wrote function for random original pokemon index
- Display pokemon name on site!

## What We Learned

- I am rusty on vanilla JS
- Pokemon are not zero indexed
- CSS Selectors = very cool
- Promises before async await are a little unweildy

## Things to Look Into

- "Pok√©mon are not zero-indexed"
- "Politoed is a good round boy."
